# Conclusion
1. Males have higher possibilities of getting heart condition than females.
2. Patients littered with heart condition ar principally in age bracket of 55-65 years.
3. Higher cholesterin means that higher possibilities of heart condition. it plays a crucial role in determinant heart issues. With age cholesterin will increase and level 200- 350 mg/dl ar of concern.
4. St_depression >0.5 millimeter in electrocardiogram indicates abnormality. thus the slope of the height exercise ST phase showing descent with st_depression>0.5 millimeter has larger possibilities of heart condition
5. From target price we will say that our dataset is amost balanced with fifty four% of patients having no heart condition and forty six you look after patients having heart condition.
6. 45.87% Of the patients detected with heart disease.
